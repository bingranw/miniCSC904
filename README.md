Use -----
To create the excel spreadsheets:
	Open the spreadsheet called 'analysis_page'.
	Copy and paste the appropriate values underneath row 3.
	Excel will automatically generate everything below row 30.
	Copy 33-122, A-P, and paste it into 1A of the spreadsheet called 'final_numbers'. (Note that you have to use 'paste special' and paste the values, otherwise it will throw up weird errors.)
	Convert the final_numbers spreadsheet into a .csv file.

To make plots:
	Change the location of where you want the plots to go (line 132).
	Run the command: bash make_things.sh
	Type '.q' a bunch. I know this is annoying, I'm working on making it less shitty :).

Enjoy beautiful plots and live life to the fullest, or something.}
